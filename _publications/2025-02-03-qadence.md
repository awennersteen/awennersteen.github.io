title: "Qadence a differentiable interface for digital and analog programs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2025-02-03-qadence
excerpt: 'In this work we present Qadence, a high-level programming interface for building complex digital and analog quantum programs. Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation combining digital gates with global analog operations acting on a register of interacting qubits. Currently, no available open-source software is tailored to express, differentiate, and execute programs within the DAQC paradigm. Qadence addresses this shortfall by seamlessly allowing the user to combine digital and analog primitives. With a flexible interface and focus on native differentiability, Qadence aims to support research in variational algorithms in these hybrid computational models.'

An older and longer version of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09915) is available for free on the arXiv.

Qadence was an experiment from Pasqal creating a new quantum framework tailored to a potential unique capability of our QPUs: mixing analog and digital modes of operation in the same program. I was the original lead of the project.

Qadence is open-source, see it's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence).
We gave a [talk](/talks/2024-01-20-PlanQC24-Qadence) the Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) conference in the [PLanQC workshop](https://popl24.sigplan.org/details/planqc-2024-papers/4/Qadence-a-differentiable-interface-for-digital-analog-programs).
