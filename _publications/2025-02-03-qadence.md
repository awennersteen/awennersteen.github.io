excerpt: 'In this work we present Qadence, a high-level programming interface for building complex digital and analog quantum programs. Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation combining digital gates with global analog operations acting on a register of interacting qubits. Currently, no available open-source software is tailored to express, differentiate, and execute programs within the DAQC paradigm. Qadence addresses this shortfall by seamlessly allowing the user to combine digital and analog primitives. With a flexible interface and focus on native differentiability, Qadence aims to support research in variational algorithms in these hybrid computational models.'

In this work we present Qadence, a high-level programming interface for building complex digital and analog quantum programs. Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation combining digital gates with global analog operations acting on a register of interacting qubits. Currently, no available open-source software is tailored to express, differentiate, and execute programs within the DAQC paradigm. Qadence addresses this shortfall by seamlessly allowing the user to combine digital and analog primitives. With a flexible interface and focus on native differentiability, Qadence aims to support research in variational algorithms in these hybrid computational models.

Qadence is open-source, see it's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence).
We gave a [talk](../_talks/2024-01-20-POPL-and-PlanQC-Qadence.md) the Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) conference in the [PLanQC workshop](https://popl24.sigplan.org/details/planqc-2024-papers/4/Qadence-a-differentiable-interface-for-digital-analog-programs).
