excerpt: 'We introduce a tensor network based emulator, simulating a programmable analog quantum processing unit (QPU). The software package is fully integrated in a cloud platform providing a common interface for executing jobs on a HPC cluster as well as dispatching them to a QPU device. We also present typical emulation use cases in the context of Neutral Atom Quantum Processors, such as evaluating the quality of a state preparation pulse sequence, and solving Maximum Independent Set problems by applying a parallel sweep over a set of input pulse parameter values, for systems composed of a large number of qubits.'

This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05253) is freely available on the arXiv.

It introduces the tensor network emulator Emu-TN and the Pasqal emulator cloud infrastructure for connecting our Kubernetes-managed infrastructure with our on-prem HPC cluster managed by Slurm to use those GPUs for running emulator jobs.
