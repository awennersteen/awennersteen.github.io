title: "Quantum resources in resource management systems"

permalink: /publications/2025-06-11-qrmi
excerpt: 'Quantum computing resources are increasingly being incorporated into high-performance computing (HPC) environments as co-processors for hybrid workloads. To support this paradigm, quantum devices must be treated as schedulable first-class resources within existing HPC infrastructure. This enables consistent workload management, unified resource visibility, and support for hybrid quantum-classical job execution models. This paper presents a reference architecture and implementation for the integration of quantum computing resources, both on-premises and cloud-hosted into HPC centers via standard workload managers. We introduce a Slurm plugin designed to abstract and control quantum backends, enabling seamless resource scheduling, minimizing queue duplication, and supporting job co-scheduling with classical compute nodes. The architecture supports heterogeneous quantum resources and can be extended to any workload (and container) management systems.'

This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10052) is available for free on the arXiv.

This collaboration, started primarily between Pasqal, IBM, STFC Hartree Center and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and later expanding to several other institutions. It is open-source software, currently split between the repo for the base [Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI)](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qrmi) and the Slurm integration component based on SPANK, in the repo [spank-plugins][https://github.com/qiskit-community/spank-plugins].

The most comprehensive overview found online is the one given by my IBM colleagues at their [OpenQSE talk](https://github.com/openQSE/openqse-admin/wiki/Meeting-2025-12-15), which is [recorded on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FdDOLTTzk) with [slides](https://github.com/openQSE/Workshops/blob/main/OpenQSE-WG/openQSE-IBM-20251215.pdf) available on the OpenQSE GitHub. From the Pasqal point of view a logical continuation of this is our work on our [on-prem integration model](/publications/2025-11-16-user-centric-qhpc), of which I also gave an [OpenQSE talk](/talks/2026-01-19-OpenQSE) available online.

The paper abstract is:
> Quantum computing resources are increasingly being incorporated into high-performance computing (HPC) environments as co-processors for hybrid workloads.
