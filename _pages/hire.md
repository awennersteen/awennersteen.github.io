For the time being I'm not actively looking to leave Pasqal and my projects but I am interested in smaller consulting jobs,
advising companies or giving talks in my areas of interests.
Always interested in speaking with interesting startups.

Some areas of interest and examples of jobs I'm interested in are:

### Strategic decisions
Need a deep-dive and recommendations in the area of advanced computing methods such as AI, Quantum, HPC?
Having been the subject-matter expert for several leaders, ranging from seasoned multi-decade c-suites to brand new ones, I have provided such advice many times over in the past.

### Technical leadership assistance for start-ups
I've gone through the motions a few times now and also experienced the pain points as you grow from a handful to beyond 300 people in the company.
I can help you avoid some pitfalls, perform due diligence or in general provide a second opinion on technical matters vs your in-house or outsourced development team(s).

###  POC buildings
In computer vision, machine learning, quantum computing and general where "advanced" numerical or algorithmic work is involved.
In my professional work I've created many POCs in these areas and having an experienced hand involved in your POC project can save a lot of time, effort and money by correctly scoping the projects and knowing some nice tricks to speed up POCs.

### High level advice
For example somewhere in the space of workload scheduling, HPC, AI, Quantum.
