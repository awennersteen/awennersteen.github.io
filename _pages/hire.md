For the time being I'm not actively looking to leave Pasqal for full-time roles.
I provide senior-level technology consulting and advisory services for organizations working at the frontier of advanced computing.
My focus is on short-term, high-impact engagements where deep technical judgment and system-level thinking materially influence outcomes.
Always interested in speaking with interesting, early-stage, startups for any reason.

## Where I typically add the most value

### High-level advisory work

I also take on **pure advisory engagements**, where the value lies in perspective rather than execution. Examples include:

- Investor expert consulting for  market intelligence
- HPC-AI-Quantum worldview
- Evaluating emerging technologies beyond vendor narratives

These engagements are typically short, focused, and decision-oriented.

### Proof-of-concept design and evaluation

I advise on and contribute to **proof-of-concept projects**, particularly where advanced numerical methods or non-standard algorithms are involved, including:

- Machine learning and computer vision
- Quantum computing and simulation
- HPC-oriented or performance-critical workloads

An experienced hand at the POC stage often saves significant time and cost by avoiding mis-scoping, over-engineering, or unrealistic expectations.

### Strategic and architectural decision-making

Organizations often reach inflection points where incremental optimization is no longer sufficient.
I support leadership teams with **technical reviews** in areas such as:

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems
- Quantum computing and hybrid quantum–classical workflows
- High-performance computing and workload orchestration
- Integration of advanced computing into production environments

My role is to clarify trade-offs, challenge assumptions, and help align technical decisions with business realities.

### Technical leadership support for startups and scale-ups

Having experienced multiple growth phases first-hand, from early teams to organizations with hundreds of engineers, I help companies navigate technical and organizational pitfalls that emerge as they scale.
Typical engagements include:


- Technical due diligence and second opinions
- Architecture, tooling, and engineering practice reviews
- Advisory support to CTOs and technical founders
- Acting as an external counterpart to in-house or outsourced teams

The goal is not to replace your team, but to strengthen decision-making at critical moments.
