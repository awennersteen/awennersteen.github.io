I'm Aleksander - a Norwegian physicist turned software engineer living in Madrid, Spain.

I'm a quantum software technical lead at [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com) where I work cross-functionally across our quantum software (libraries + emulation) and cloud platform.
The rest of my time I dedicate to exploring LLMs/ChatBots (especially with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques) and running LLMs on edge-devices.
I'm also looking into the tourism and hospitality industry at [MyConcierges](https://MyConcierges.ai) and working on solving bureaucracy at [Tramitit](https://tramitit.com).

Twice I've tried to create my own startups, both times failing early. Once in the area of renting clothes to combat fast fashion and another in modernizing the construction industry.
Those are good examples of industries that I'm interested in targeting as I believe that they have both large addressable markets, but there there can be large social and environmental gains to be had.

I'm trying to publish my thoughts on software, quantum, AI and anything else under [musings](posts).
