I'm Aleksander - a Norwegian living in Madrid, Spain. I'm a quantum software technical lead at [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com) where I work cross-functionally across our quantum software (libraries + emulation) and cloud platform. My technical interest are in the intersection of HPC, ML/AI and Quantum, and I'm also very interested in developing a business vision of these areas.

The rest of my time I dedicate to exploring LLMs/ChatBots (especially with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques) and running LLMs on edge-devices.

Twice I've tried to create my own startups, both times failing early. Once in the area of renting clothes to combat fast fashion and another in modernizing the construction industry.
Those are good examples of industries that I'm interested in targeting as I believe that they have both large addressable markets, but there there can be large social and environmental gains to be had.

Currently I'm looking into the tourism and hospitality industry in a similar manner at [MyConcierges](https://MyConcierges.ai) and working on solving bureaucracy at [Tramitit](https://tramitit.com).

On the pure technical side as I've progressed in my career I've become very interested in the theory of software engineering and architecture, leadership. I hope to find time soon to add some posts on that to my [musings](posts).
