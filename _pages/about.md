Aleksander is a physicist turned software engineer working at the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing.
Throughout my career I've been pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and pioneering innovative solutions.
So far I've worked in quantum computing, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and high performance computing.

Currently, I work at [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com) as technical lead quantum-centric HPC.
This is a very cross-functional role which consists of not only designing systems and writing software, but also
advising on strategy, go-to-market plans, and responding to public procurements and other grants.

I am available for **consulting and advisory engagements**, if this is of interest, more details are available on the [consulting page](./hire/).

---

Occasionally, I write on software, quantum, AI and anything else in the blog [musings](./posts/).

I enjoy [talking at conferences](./talks/) and I try to mostly view the world from a birdseye view when I do so.
The recordings I'm aware of have been collected in a [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqOOyYw_3asFPDvdKBex_jLCMXz98Bls).
For example, the talk at [PLanQC24 @ POPL](/talks/2024-01-20-PlanQC24-Qadence) is available on the [POPL YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WwZO42-btc).

The rest of my time I dedicate to exploring LLMs/ChatBots (especially with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques) and running LLMs on edge-devices.
For example I have tried to applied them to areas like TravelTech and PropTech.
