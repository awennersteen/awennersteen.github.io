Aleksander is a physicist turned software engineer working at the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing.
Throughout my career I've been pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and pioneering innovative solutions.
So far I've worked in quantum computing, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and high performance computing.

Currently, I work at [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com) as technical lead quantum-centric HPC.
This is a very cross-functional role which consists of not only designing systems and writing software, but also
advising the board on strategy, commercial on go-to-market plans and sales pitches, and public procurements and other grants.

The rest of my time I dedicate to exploring LLMs/ChatBots (especially with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques) and running LLMs on edge-devices.
I'm also looking into the tourism and hospitality industry at [MyConcierges](https://MyConcierges.ai) and working on solving bureaucracy at [Tramitit](https://tramitit.com).

If interested you can even [hire me](./hire/) for short term engagements or advice!

Twice I've tried to create my own startups, both times failing early. Once in the area of renting clothes to combat fast fashion and another in modernizing the construction industry.
Those are good examples of industries that I'm interested in targeting as I believe that they have both large addressable markets, but there there can be large social and environmental gains to be had.

I'm trying to publish my thoughts on software, quantum, AI and anything else under [musings](./posts/).

I enjoy [talking at conferences](./talks/) and I try to mostly view the world from a birdseye view when I do so.
There is a playlist of the recordings I'm aware of on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqOOyYw_3asFPDvdKBex_jLCMXz98Bls).
For example you can watch my [PLanQC 24 @ POPL talk](/talks/2024-01-20-PlanQC24-Qadence) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WwZO42-btc).
