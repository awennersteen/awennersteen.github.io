European Quantum Software and Systems Summit (EQS3)'s third edition took place the 17th - 19th of April 2024 at DTU
in Denmark.
Some interesting days of discussions between the quantum and HPC world with particular focus on abstractions, handoff points
and to what extent the different qubit modalities have different so requirements we need separate stacks.
I presented Pasqal's current architecture and some of our viewpoints for the future.
