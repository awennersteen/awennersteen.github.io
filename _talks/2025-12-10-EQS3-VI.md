European Quantum Software and Systems Summit (EQS3)'s 6th edition took place the 9th-11th of December 2025 at the LINKS Foundation in Torino, Italy.
This session was focused on the software connecting QCs to the HPC infrastructure, particularly centered around the QDMI (Quantum Device Management Interface) From the MQSS.
I was invited to give an overview to our similar QRMI (Quantum Resource Management Interface) and discuss how they compare and might co-exists and co-evolve in the future.

As always the discussions were very interesting.
