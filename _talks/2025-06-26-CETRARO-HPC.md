I had the pleasure of attending the 32nd edition of the invite-only "International Advanced Research Workshop on High Performance Computing"
held, as always, in Cetraro (Italy), June 23 – 27, 2025 to present our strategy towards quantum supercomputing at Pasqal.

Quantum computing promises to accelerate select high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
Realizing this potential will require deep integration of quantum and classical resources, demanding close collaboration between the quantum and HPC communities to develop truly hybrid supercomputing systems.
In this talk, we focus on quantum processing units (QPUs) based on neutral atoms and discuss how they are being integrated into HPC centers. From the physical infrastructure to co-processing workflows and scheduling.
We present the capabilities of Pasqal’s devices and platform and then outline our near-term hardware developments and explain how these advances shape and support the broader goal of building a hybrid quantum-classical computing platform.
