I presented on behalf of Pasqals emulation team our work on tensor network simulations of pulse level programming of neutral atom QPUs as well as our work on differentiable simulators for digital-analog algorithms. The work presented centred around our whitepaper for the cloud-based tensor network emulator (EMU-TN)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05253] and the emulators built for the then not yet released (Qadence)[https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence] digital-analog quantum programming interface.

At the end of the day I also sat in the final panel discussion for this two day workshop where we were discussing both the state of the art of simulations and what challenges we have and how we might overcome this. As is inevitable this quickly also touched on exactly how easy it may be to attack quantum computing advantage claims with tensor network methods.
