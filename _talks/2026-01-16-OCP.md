I was invited to give a talk titled "Making QPUs First-Class HPC Resources" at the [Open Compute Project](https://opencompute.org)'s Future Technology Initiative (OCP FTI) [Data Center Integration of Quantum Information Infrastructure](https://www.opencompute.org/projects/data-center-integration-of-quantum-information-infrastructure) working group.
The talk focused on the software side of HPC integration, and how this may generalise to general data center integration of QPUs.

Title:
Making QPUs First-Class HPC Resources

Abstract:
> As quantum processors are integrated into HPC centers, the limiting factor is no longer access to hardware but the lack of mature software infrastructure. Treating QPUs as experimental peripherals leads to poor utilization, fragmented user workflows, and duplicated scheduling layers. In particular runtime design, resource management, and integration with existing HPC infrastructure determine whether quantum processing units can be used effectively in a quantum-centric workflow.
>  
> This talk presents lessons learned from deploying Pasqal neutral-atom quantum processors into HPC centers. After an introduction to Pasqal's hardware we discuss how QPUs can be exposed as first-class schedulable resources with open-source initiatives like the Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI), how hybrid workloads are orchestrated across classical and quantum resources, and how observability and control planes must evolve to support real operations.
