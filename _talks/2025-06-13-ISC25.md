High performance computing environments differ significantly from quantum labs, and real-world workloads differ significantly from algorithm research. Besides programming another gargantuan challenge is resource management and scheduling maximizing the real utilization of the devices. In this talk, we share lessons learnt and plans from deploying two of Pasqal’s analog neutral-atom systems, with three more underway. As a vendor a key challenge is aligning with the different sites' software stacks and preferences. Solving this as a community, for example by creating widely adopted, open-source, quantum software remains a major challenge. Pasqal’s focus is on open sourcing some of its internal software, centred around our two SDKs Pulser and Qadence, as well as integrating with some of the largest quantum ecosystems and adopting existing HPC technologies.
