description: "Talks at ISC-HPC 2025 on software at the quantum-HPC boundary, including resource management, scheduling, and practical integration across partners and sites."
excerpt: "At ISC-HPC 2025 I gave two talks and a meet-the-experts session on software for heterogeneous quantum computing. Topics included resource management and scheduling, QRMI/Slurm integration, and what it takes to deploy neutral-atom QPUs into real HPC environments."

At this years [ISC](https:://isc-hpc.com) I gave two talks, and also a "meet the experts" session at the booth of the Julich Supercomputing Center.
IBM Quantum had a workshop where themselves and partners gave updates on the the state of quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC).
I gave a talk on "Software for heterogeneous quantum computing", presenting our joint work on creating a joint software-stack for QCSC.
Primarily the work on [resource management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10052), the associated [code](https://github.com/qiskit-community/spank-plugins) for spank plugins for quantum resources and jobs,
and our [Qiskit integration](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-pasqal-provider).

Later in the week I spoke at the 4th [Quantum and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Approaches Workshop](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/events/quantum-and-hybrid-quantum-classical-computing-approaches-workshop/), on "Software at  the intersection of Quantum and HPC". Where I in addition to our work with IBM, I spoke about
our work with Nvidia, such as the [CUDA-Q integration](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/backends/hardware/neutralatom.html#pasqal), and the recent integrations
of Pasqal's QPUs at CEA, JSC and the upcoming ones at DistriQ, Aramco and CINECA.

The abstract:
High performance computing environments differ significantly from quantum labs, and real-world workloads differ significantly from algorithm research. Besides programming another gargantuan challenge is resource management and scheduling maximizing the real utilization of the devices. In this talk, we share lessons learnt and plans from deploying two of Pasqal’s analog neutral-atom systems, with three more underway. As a vendor a key challenge is aligning with the different sites' software stacks and preferences. Solving this as a community, for example by creating widely adopted, open-source, quantum software remains a major challenge. Pasqal’s focus is on open sourcing some of its internal software, centred around our two SDKs Pulser and Qadence, as well as integrating with some of the largest quantum ecosystems and adopting existing HPC technologies.
