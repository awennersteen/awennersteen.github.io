I gave a talk at the [OpenQSE](https://openqse.org/) (Open QHPC Software Ecosystem) initiative architecture seminar series.
You can find the meeting notes [here](https://github.com/openQSE/openqse-admin/wiki/Meeting-2026-01-19), and the slides will appear on the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/openQSE/Workshops/tree/main/OpenQSE-WG).

My talk was focused on the middleware we are developing at Pasqal including a 2nd level scheduler that will take care of scheduling the quantum tasks.
