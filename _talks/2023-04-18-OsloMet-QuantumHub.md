An introduction to neutral atoms based QC and what we do in industry to the faculties at various institutions in Oslo.

I was invited to present here after attending another interesting event in Oslo, [QCNorway](https://qcnorway.no), which was an event to seek input for a future Norwegian national quantum strategy, culminating in the organisers writing an article on the topic. Official Norwegian quantum strategy is sadly still to come.

It was very interesting to be given a chance to give a rather long-form talk and present a little bit about what I'm doing to the Norwegian community, as well as providing some much needed honesty from the commercial side of the industry which I understood was much appreciated.
