Attended the yearly all-hands of the "Quantum-centric Supercomputing for Materials Science" working group organized by IBM and held at the R-CCS in Kobe.
We had 2 days of talks and discussions focused on quantum-HPC integration and applications in materials science, chemistry and condensed matter. 

It was also great to see the supercomputer Fugaku and the IBM System 2 co-located at RIKEN.
Especially, having first encountered what was to become the Fugaku back in 2016/2017 with the emulator of the custom-built ARM chip.

We presented an early teaser of upcoming work, which will have to be posted here on a later date.
