Supercomputing 2024 took place 17th - 22nd of November 2024 in Atlanta..
With a record of over 18 000 attendees and almost 500 exhibitors it's the highlight of the HPC calendar.
It was great to catch up with friends, partners, and new connections and to discuss with all the other attendees.
I gave talks at Pasqal's booth and at partner booths.
